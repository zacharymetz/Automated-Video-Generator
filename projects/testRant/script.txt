Good evening America,

We are in the middle of a crisis of epic proportion,
and we will try to give you the latest updates on the evolving situation.
[# explain][@ up]
And That's what we do, we're here to give you the truth.
[# relaxed][@ down][! Slot Machines] 
However, this situation is so horrible, that the monsters behind it try to target the most vulnerable in our society.

[$ angry]
They will disguise slot machines as fun and innocent little things video games.
[$ base]
I  am of course talking about the rise of micro transactions in video games of all platforms and genres.

Weve tolerated them in free to play games like clash of clans and candy crush.
[# questioning][$ angry]
The elites even told us to laugh at how silly people who spend money on micro transactions in games really are. 

Until they left us is no other option than to purchase micro transactions because it's been baked into the core of every game.
[$ strait]

Enslaving us in a sort of micro transaction way, with seemingly no routes of escape.
