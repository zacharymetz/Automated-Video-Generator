[[History Of Mobile Me]]

[Intro]
Mobile was initaliy released on January 5 2000 brnaded as Itools,
it was later rebraned to dot Mac in 2002 and then finially being changed to the iconic Mobile Me in 2008, 
It is a discontinued subscription-based collection of online services and software offered by Apple Inc.
All services were gradually transitioned to and eventually replaced by the free iCloud, and MobileMe ceased on June 30, 2012.

iTools and .Mac were designed primarily to provide Internet services for Mac owners. 
All members of iTools and .Mac received a @mac.com email address, showing the services tied to the Mac hardware. 
However, with the release of the iPhone 3G in 2008, the renamed service, MobileMe, began providing Internet services for OS X, iOS, and Windows. 
Members of MobileMe were given a @me.com email address (though users of the current @mac.com email address could also continue to use those, with both domains being interchangeable with the same email account), were also no longer restricted to OS X software such as Mail and iCal, and they could access personal data from any computer connected to the Internet using the web interface at me.com or a number of supported applications, including Microsoft Outlook, as long as the user used version 2003 or later.
Apple support for MobileMe was available via chat and telephone (the latter restricted to US/Canada users only).
